% 
% TO COMPILE:
% > pdflatex thisfile.tex
%
% If you do not have LaTeX and need a LaTeX distribution:
% - Personal laptops (all common OS): www.latex-project.org/get/
% - We recommend miktex (https://miktex.org/) for latex engine,
%   and TeXstudio(http://www.texstudio.org/) for latex editor.
%   You should install both programs for editing latex.
%   Or you can use Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) which is 
%   an online latex editor.
%
% If you need help with LaTeX, please come to office hours. 
% Or, there is plenty of help online:

\paragraph{Q1:} We wish to set all pixels that have a brightness of 10 or less to 0, to remove sensor noise. However, our code is slow when run on a database with 1000 grayscale images.

\emph{Image:} \href{grizzlypeakg.png}{grizzlypeakg.png}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
A = imread('grizzlypeakg.png');
[m1,n1] = size( A );
for i=1:m1
    for j=1:n1
        if A(i,j) <= 10
            A(i,j) = 0;
        end
    end
end
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q1.1:} How could we speed it up?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A1.1:} Your answer here.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
B=imread('grizzlypeakg.png');
[m2,n2] = size( B );
C = B < 10;
B(C) = 0;
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q1.2:} What factor speedup would we receive over 1000 images? Please measure it.

Ignore file loading; assume all images are equal resolution; don't assume that the time taken for one image $\times1000$ will equal $1000$ image computations, as single short tasks on multitasking computers often take variable time.

\paragraph{Q2:} We wish to reduce the brightness of an image but, when trying to visualize the result, all we sees is white with some weird ``corruption'' of color patches.

\emph{Image:} \href{gigi.jpg}{gigi.jpg}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
I = double( imread('gigi.jpg') );
I = I - 20;
imshow( I );
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q2.1:} What is incorrect with this approach? How can it be fixed while maintaining the same amount of brightness reduction?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A2.1:} Your answer here.

I should use im2double instead of double function.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
I = imread('gigi.jpg');
I = I - 20;
doubleI = im2double(I);
imshow(doubleI);
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q2.2:} Where did the original corruption come from? Which specific values in the original image did it represent?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A2.2:} Your answer here.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
I1 = im2double(imread('gigi.jpg'));
I1 = I1 - 20;

I2 = imread('gigi.jpg');
I2 = I2 - 20;
doubleI2 = double(I2);
\end{lstlisting}
In code, I1 and doubleI2 are both problematic.

	If you use "im2double" function, the value of (uint8) 0-255 changes to (double) 0-1.  I1 used an "im2double" function, but after using the function, it did -20. So all black out. I2 did -20 first, but not im2double function. So It makes "corruption".
